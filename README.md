Web forms

This project increased my comfortability in writing both HTML and CSS by allowing me to reuse skills from our previous project while learning new skills about building forms. My survery focuses on finding popular extracurricular activies that students do in their free time.

The third question of this survey asks the respondent to share what gender they identify as. To begin, I made this field a non-required because it is not information that I need but I needed to ask it per the project specifications. There is also a "prefer not to say" option for those who do not want to share but still want to respond to the question. Looking at the website provided, I decided to have male, female, non-binary, and other as the answer choices. I chose to do this since I am not well educated enough in the field to begin listing off different genders. Having the "other" option allows for there to be an option for everyone.
