Web forms

This project increased my comfortability in writing both HTML and CSS by allowing me to reuse skills from our previous project while learning new skills about building forms. My survey focuses on finding popular extracurricular activities that students do in their free time.

It is important for website users to be able to navigate a page other ways then just using the mouse. Setting autofocus ensures that each user starts out on the first portion of the survey that need to fill out without having to use a mouse to direct themselves there. I also set it so that users can tab through each questions and use the enter key to move to the next page once they have tabbed down to the next page button.

Using shades of the same color across my page is helpful to those who are color blind because it is less likely they will be unable to miss a detail or be unable to see something due to the color choice. Using the same colors on each page and keeping things uniform allows respondents to have a sense of familiarity with each page.

The third question of this survey asks the respondent to share what gender they identify as. To begin, I made this field a non-required because it is not information that I need but I needed to ask it per the project specifications. There is also a "prefer not to say" option for those who do not want to share but still want to respond to the question. Looking at the website provided, I decided to have male, female, non-binary, and other as the answer choices. I chose to do this since I am not well educated enough in the field to begin listing off different genders. Having the "other" option allows for there to be an option for everyone.
